> **Port status:** this repository is now the Kimi-first fork. The main runtime, setup path, and focused verification suite have been moved to Kimi-first behavior. For the current compatibility boundary and unsupported disclosures, see the [oh-my-kimi v1 compatibility guide](./docs/oh-my-kimi-v1-compatibility.md).

OMK is a workflow layer for Kimi Code CLI.
`omk` is the primary command name; `omx` is currently kept as a compatibility alias during migration.

It keeps Kimi Code CLI as the execution engine and makes it easier to:
- start a stronger Kimi session by default
- run one consistent workflow from clarification to completion
- invoke the canonical skills with `$deep-interview`, `$ralplan`, `$team`, and `$ralph`
- keep project guidance, plans, logs, and state in `.omx/`

## Recommended default flow

If you want the default OMK experience, start here:

```bash
npm install -g oh-my-kimi
omk setup
omk --madmax --high
```

Then work normally inside Kimi Code CLI:

```text
$deep-interview "clarify the authentication change"
$ralplan "approve the auth plan and review tradeoffs"
$ralph "carry the approved plan to completion"
$team 3:executor "execute the approved plan in parallel"
```

That is the main path.
Start OMK strongly, clarify first when needed, approve the plan, then choose `$team` for coordinated parallel execution or `$ralph` for the persistent completion loop.

## What OMK is for

Use OMK if you already like Kimi Code and want a better day-to-day runtime around it:
- a standard workflow built around `$deep-interview`, `$ralplan`, `$team`, and `$ralph`
- specialist roles and supporting skills when the task needs them
- project guidance through scoped `AGENTS.md`
- durable state under `.omx/` for plans, logs, memory, and mode tracking

If you want plain Kimi Code CLI with no extra workflow layer, you probably do not need OMK.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Kimi Code CLI installed
- Kimi authentication configured
- `tmux` on macOS/Linux if you later want the durable team runtime
- `psmux` on native Windows if you later want Windows team mode

### A good first session

Launch OMK the recommended way:

```bash
omk --madmax --high
```

Then try the canonical workflow:

```text
$deep-interview "clarify the authentication change"
$ralplan "approve the safest implementation path"
$ralph "carry the approved plan to completion"
$team 3:executor "execute the approved plan in parallel"
```

Use `$team` when the approved plan needs coordinated parallel work, or `$ralph` when one persistent owner should keep pushing to completion.

## A simple mental model

OMK does **not** replace Kimi Code CLI.

It adds a better working layer around it:
- **Kimi Code CLI** does the actual agent work
- **OMK role keywords** make useful roles reusable
- **OMK skills** make common workflows reusable
- **`.omx/`** stores plans, logs, memory, and runtime state

Most users should think of OMK as **better task routing + better workflow + better runtime**, not as a command surface to operate manually all day.

## Start here if you are new

1. Run `omk setup`
2. Launch with `omk --madmax --high`
3. Use `$deep-interview "..."` when the request or boundaries are still unclear
4. Use `$ralplan "..."` to approve the plan and review tradeoffs
5. Choose `$team` for coordinated parallel execution or `$ralph` for persistent completion loops

## Recommended workflow

1. `$deep-interview` — clarify scope when the request or boundaries are still vague.
2. `$ralplan` — turn that clarified scope into an approved architecture and implementation plan.
3. `$team` or `$ralph` — use `$team` for coordinated parallel execution, or `$ralph` when you want a persistent completion loop with one owner.

## Common in-session surfaces

| Surface | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `$deep-interview "..."` | clarifying intent, boundaries, and non-goals |
| `$ralplan "..."` | approving the implementation plan and tradeoffs |
| `$ralph "..."` | persistent completion and verification loops |
| `$team "..."` | coordinated parallel execution when the work is big enough |
| `/skills` | browsing installed skills and supporting helpers |

## Advanced / operator surfaces

These are useful, but they are not the main onboarding path.

### Team runtime

Use the team runtime when you specifically need durable tmux/worktree coordination, not as the default way to begin using OMK.

```bash
omk team 3:executor "fix the failing tests with verification"
omk team status <team-name>
omk team resume <team-name>
omk team shutdown <team-name>
```

### Setup, doctor, and HUD

These are operator/support surfaces:
- `omk setup` installs prompts, skills, config, and AGENTS scaffolding
- `omk doctor` verifies the install when something seems wrong
- `omk hud --watch` is a monitoring/status surface, not the primary user workflow
- `omx ...` still works as a temporary alias while the port is being cleaned up

### Explore and sparkshell

- `omk explore --prompt "..."` is for read-only repository lookup
- `omk sparkshell <command>` is for shell-native inspection and bounded verification

Examples:

```bash
omk explore --prompt "find where team state is written"
omk sparkshell git status
omk sparkshell --tmux-pane %12 --tail-lines 400
```

### Platform notes for team mode

`omk team` needs a tmux-compatible backend:

| Platform | Install |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `brew install tmux` |
| Ubuntu/Debian | `sudo apt install tmux` |
| Fedora | `sudo dnf install tmux` |
| Arch | `sudo pacman -S tmux` |
| Windows | `winget install psmux` |
| Windows (WSL2) | `sudo apt install tmux` |

## Known issues

### Intel Mac: high `syspolicyd` / `trustd` CPU during startup

On some Intel Macs, OMK startup — especially with `--madmax --high` — can spike `syspolicyd` / `trustd` CPU usage while macOS Gatekeeper validates many concurrent process launches.

If this happens, try:
- `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine $(which omk)`
- adding your terminal app to the Developer Tools allowlist in macOS Security settings
- using lower concurrency (for example, avoid `--madmax --high`)
